  "description": "We highly recommend validators use Cosmovisor to run their nodes. This will make low-downtime upgrades smoother, as validators don't have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade. Instead users can pre-install new binaries, and Cosmovisor will automatically update them based on on-chain Software Upgrade proposals.",
