#  Frequently Asked Questions

## Wallets

<details>
<summary><b>Which wallet would you recommend for Flamez?</b></summary>
We recommend using wallets that support Binance Smart Chain (BSC), such as Metamask and Trust Wallet. These wallets are widely supported and have easy-to-use interfaces.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Can I use my Ledger device?</b></summary>
Yes! You can use your Ledger device with Flamez. Just make sure you have set up your Ledger device to work with Binance Smart Chain. You can find instructions on how to do this on the Binance Academy website.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>For certain wallets, I see both bech32 and hex while others only show hex formatted addresses, which should I use?</b></summary>
Flamez supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which uses the hexadecimal address format. When you are interacting with Flamez, you should use your BSC address in hexadecimal format. If your wallet also shows a bech32 address, it's likely that this address is for a different blockchain.

</details>

## Trading

<details>
<summary><b>How can I add liquidity to Flamez?</b></summary>
To add liquidity to Flamez, navigate to the "Liquidity" page on the Flamez platform. There, you can select the tokens you'd like to provide as liquidity. After approving the transaction in your wallet, your tokens will be added to the liquidity pool and you'll receive LP tokens in return.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>What are LP tokens?</b></summary>
LP tokens, or liquidity provider tokens, represent your share in a liquidity pool on Flamez. When you add liquidity to a pool, you receive LP tokens. These tokens can be used to reclaim your share of the pool, including any fees earned, at any time.

</details>

## Safety

<details>
<summary><b>How can I stay safe when using Flamez?</b></summary>
Always ensure you are on the official Flamez website and double-check all transaction details before confirming. Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone, even if they claim to be from the Flamez team. Remember, anyone with access to your private keys or seed phrase can access your funds.

</details>

## Swaps

<details>
<summary><b>What is slippage?</b></summary>
Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. It's a common occurrence in trading, especially in decentralized exchanges like Flamez where price can change rapidly due to market conditions. You can set your tolerance for slippage in the settings. A higher slippage tolerance means your trade is more likely to go through, but you might get a worse price.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Why did my transaction fail?</b></summary>
Transactions can fail for several reasons. Some of the most common include:

Insufficient gas fees: Every transaction on the Binance Smart Chain requires gas. If you don't have enough BNB in your wallet to cover the gas fee, your transaction will fail.
Price impact too high: If your trade would significantly affect the token price, it might fail due to a high price impact.
Slippage tolerance too low: If the price changes between when you submit the transaction and when it's processed, and the change is greater than your slippage tolerance, the transaction will fail.
</details>

## Farming and Staking

<details>
<summary><b>What is yield farming?</b></summary>
Yield farming, also referred to as liquidity mining, is a way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, it means locking up cryptocurrencies and getting rewards. In the context of Flamez, you can deposit your LP tokens into a farming contract and earn Flamez tokens as rewards.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>What is staking?</b></summary>
Staking involves participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) system to help secure the network. By staking Flamez tokens, you can earn more tokens over time. It's similar to yield farming, but typically involves less risk.
