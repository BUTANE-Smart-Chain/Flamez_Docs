# Affilate Program 

Flamez's Affiliate Program is designed to reward those who continue to help expand the community and ignite our vision. The program will be available at the start to a select group of Flamez advocates, and the Flamez Team plans to roll it out to more users. As an affiliate, you'll be part of a network of like-minded individuals committed to building a stronger DeFi community.

## Becoming an Affiliate

Becoming an affiliate is a breeze. All you need to do is visit our [Flamez Affiliate Page](https://butane.tech), where you will find all the information you need to get started. Alternatively, you can fill out an [Affiliate Application Form](https://butane.tech).

Once you’ve submitted your application, the Flamez Team will review your application and determine if you are a good fit for the program. This process may take some time, so please be patient with us! If approved, we will reach out to you via your email or telegram.

If the Flamez Team approves your application, you will be granted access to the affiliate dashboard by connecting your wallet submitted in the program application. This dashboard will provide you with a range of tools and resources that you can use to share the Flamez's products or services and track your commission.

Once you can access the dashboard, you can create affiliate links to share with your community. You will earn a commission when a new user clicks on your affiliate link and makes a specific transaction. Ensure you always use your affiliate link when sharing your passion for Flamez!
