**Details:**

- Introduce three tiers of staking rewards: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.
- Bronze Tier: Stakers with 1,000 to 10,000 $FLAMEZ tokens will receive a reward of X% APR.
- Silver Tier: Stakers with 10,001 to 100,000 $FLAMEZ tokens will receive a reward of Y% APR.
- Gold Tier: Stakers with over 100,000 $FLAMEZ tokens will receive a reward of Z% APR.
- The tier-based rewards will be calculated and distributed on a monthly basis.

**Voting Options:**
