# How to Play Lottery

Flamez's Lottery is not only a good way to make stacks of FLAMEZ, it's also loads of fun! This guide will walk you through getting involved in the Lottery.

The Lottery has changed a little since its first iteration. Lottery v2 lets you win more often, have some control over your tickets, and has more potential for huge FLAMEZ jackpots to get your mouth watering. Learn more about Flamez Lottery [here](#).

## Deciding if you'd like to enter a round

Not all Lottery rounds are equal. When a lottery jackpot isn't won, the next round's prize pool will increase; the longer it's been since someone has won the jackpot, the larger the Lottery prize pool will be.

The longer a round is open, the more people can buy a ticket. Each ticket sold increases the prize pool further. Here's how to check the current round's prize pool and remaining time.

1. Visit the Flamez Lottery page and look at the top of the page. You'll see the current round's prize pool shown in (estimated) US dollar value. This is the amount to be shared between all winners.
2. A little lower down the page you'll find the remaining time before the current round is drawn.

Remember, a lot can change in the remaining time. Many more tickets may be sold. Each sold ticket both increases the prize pool, and lowers the odds of an individual ticket winning.

If you're unsure, you can always wait until later into the round to decide with more information. Just don't wait too long and miss out!

## Buying Lottery tickets

Buying tickets is easy. You just need a little FLAMEZ though: each ticket costs approximately $5 USD (the exact FLAMEZ price is set at the start of the round).

You can choose to either randomize your lottery ticket numbers, or to choose your ticket numbers manually. Choose between the randomized numbers and manual numbers tabs below for a guide to each method.

### Randomized ticket numbers

1. On the Flamez Lottery page, click the Buy Tickets button at the top of the page (there's another lower on the page also).
2. A window will open letting you choose how many ticket to buy. Type how many tickets you'd like to buy into the field. You can also use the preset buttons underneath.
3. Before you continue, it's worth considering the bulk purchase discounts. The more tickets you buy, the greater the discount. The discount starts at 2 tickets, and scales all the way to 100 tickets where you will save almost 5% on your purchase.
4. When you're happy with the number of tickets you want to buy, click Confirm and confirm your action in your wallet.

### Viewing your tickets after buying

You can view your tickets after buying them before the round's numbers are drawn.

1. Click View Your Tickets in the "Next Draw" area of the Lottery page.
2. A window will open showing all of your tickets and their numbers. It'll also give you the option to buy more tickets if you'd like.

## When the round ends and winning numbers are drawn

When the round has ended and the winning numbers are available, you can check your tickets to see if you won.
