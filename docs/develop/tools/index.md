# Lottery

Playing the Flamez Lottery gives you a chance to win huge FLAMEZ prizes! It's easy, fair, and you can enter as often as you like as long as you have the FLAMEZ to buy a ticket.

## Specifics:
- Lottery ticket cost for 1 ticket: ~1000 FLAMEZ
- Individual user Lottery entry limit: No overall limit, but only 100 tickets can be bought at a time.
- Paying for one ticket will give users a random 6-digit combination with each digit being between 0-9, for e.g. "1-9-3-2-0-4". Match numbers from the left to win prizesâ€”the more numbers that match, the bigger the prize pool you'll share in.
- Lottery uses Chainlink's implementation of VRF for true, secure randomness.

## Ticket costs and bulk purchase discount
Lottery ticket prices are set at the start of the new lottery round, and target $5 USD (may vary slightly with sudden price fluctuations).

Buying multiple Lottery tickets at once gives a bulk discount on your purchase. You can buy as many as 100 tickets in one purchase, with the discount starting small at 2 tickets, and scaling up to 4.95% at 100 tickets.

## How to win
Match numbers, from the left side of your ticket, to the winning numbers drawn at the end of a Lottery round.

- Matching even just the first number will win you a small prize.
- Match more numbers to win a share of a larger prize pool.

## Prize eligibility
There are a total of six lottery balls, from 0 to 9, on each ticket. To win, your numbers need to match the drawn numbers in the same order as the lottery balls, starting from the left of the ticket.

## Prize sharing across prize brackets
After a round is drawn, and tickets with matching numbers are determined, the prizes are awarded. The amount won by each ticket will depend on how many other tickets won in the same prize bracket.
