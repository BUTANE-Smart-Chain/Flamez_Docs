Yield farming can give better rewards than Pools, but it comes with a risk of Impermanent Loss. Itâ€™s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.


## Reward calculations

Yield Farm APR calculation includes both the rewards earned through providing liquidity and rewards earned staking LP Tokens in the Farm.

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## Below is a basic explanation of how APR is calculated.


- Liquidity: $387.42M
- Volume 24H: $96.97M
- Volume 7D: 709.73M

To calculate the APR, first we take the 24hour volume, $96,970,000, and calculate the fee-share of LP-holders, 0.17% [$96,970,000*0.17/100 = $164,849].

Next, we estimate the yearly fees based on the 24h volume [$164,849*365 = $60,169,885].

Now we can calculate the fee APR with yearly fees divided by liquidity [($60,169,885/$387,420,000)*100 = 15.53%] With the fee APR, we can add the fee APR (15.53%) and the Farm staking APR (20.08%) to get the new total APR [15.53%+20.08% = 35.61%].
