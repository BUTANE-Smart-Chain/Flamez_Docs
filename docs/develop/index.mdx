## Token Swaps

Token swaps on Flamez are a simple way to trade one BEP20 token for another via automated liquidity pools.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange, you will pay a 0.30% trading fee, which is broken down as follows:

- 0.15% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.
- 0.05% - Buyback FLAMEZ for burn/ Stable coin Pool
- 0.05% - Project Support Program
- 0.05% - Sent to the Flamez Treasury.

## How to Trade

Trading on Flamez is very easy compared to most exchanges. You aren't going to be overwhelmed by charts or jargon, and calculations are all handled for you.

### Getting set up to trade

Before you can trade, you will need a Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet. You will also need to have some BEP20 tokens to trade with.

### Trading on the Flamez exchange

1. Go to the exchange page.
2. Unlock your Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking Unlock Wallet (you can also Connect in the top right-hand corner).
3. Choose the token you want to trade from the dropdown menu in the "From" section. The default setting is BNB.
4. Choose the token you want to trade to in the "To" section as above. Next, type an amount for your "To" currency by clicking inside the input box.
5. Check the details, and click the Swap button.
6. A window with more details will appear. Check the details are correct.
7. Done! You can click View on BscScan to see your transaction details on the explorer.

# Liquidity Pools

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited FLAMEZ and BNB into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive FLAMEZ-BNB LP tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the FLAMEZ-BNB Liquidity Pool.

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.

Whenever someone trades on Flamez, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

"Liquidity" is central to how Flamez's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair, and receive LP Tokens you can stake in Farms to earn FLAMEZ rewards!

## Adding liquidity
