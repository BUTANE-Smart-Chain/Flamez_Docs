# How to Stake in Pools

## How to Stake in Pools with Flamez

Flamez provides an easy way for you to earn $AME or other tokens while you rest! It's simpler than farming with Flamez's Yield Farms, since you only need to stake one token, typically $AME.

## Getting Started with Pool Staking on Flamez

1. Navigate to the Pools page on Flamez's platform.

2. Connect your Butane Smart Chain-compatible wallet by selecting the Connect button located in the upper right-hand corner of the webpage.

3. Click on "Unlock Wallet".

4. Choose the Pool in which you wish to stake.

    - **Auto FLAMEZ** automatically compounds your rewards: any FLAMEZ you earn will be automatically harvested and reinvested into the same pool.
    
    - **Manual FLAMEZ** does not automatically compound your earnings like Auto FLAMEZ does. You'll have to harvest and compound your earnings manually.
    
    - **Other Pools** allow you to stake your FLAMEZ to earn an assortment of other exciting tokens. Be sure to explore these options.

5. After selecting a pool, click the "Enable" button. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm this action.

6. Once confirmed, the "Enable" button should now be replaced with "Stake". Click this button to open the staking menu.

7. Input an amount or use the slider to select how much FLAMEZ you wish to stake.

8. Click "Confirm". Your wallet will prompt you to confirm this action.

9. The "Confirm" button will change to "Confirming". Upon successful completion of the transaction, you'll see the amount of your staked tokens change and the button will change again.

10. You should now be able to view your Pool details. Auto FLAMEZ will display a countdown until the unstaking fee period ends. Other pools will show a "Collect" button, enabling you to claim your staking rewards directly to your wallet.

## Adding and Removing FLAMEZ from a Pool

Adding more FLAMEZ to a Pool or shifting FLAMEZ to a more profitable pool is straightforward. Here's how to manage your staked FLAMEZ:

1. Click the "-" symbol to withdraw some FLAMEZ from a pool, or the "+" symbol to add more FLAMEZ to the pool.

    Please note that unstaking from the Auto FLAMEZ pool incurs a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2. A window will appear. If you clicked the "+", select the amount you wish to add to the pool. If you clicked the "-", select the amount you want to withdraw from the pool.

3. Click "Confirm".

4. After a brief wait, you should be able to see your updated amount of staked tokens.
