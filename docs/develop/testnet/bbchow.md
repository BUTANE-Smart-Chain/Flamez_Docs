## Auto FLAMEZ & Manual FLAMEZ Pools

Wondering about the differences between the "Auto FLAMEZ Pool" and the "Manual FLAMEZ Pool"?

Both pools allow you to stake your FLAMEZ tokens to earn more FLAMEZ tokens. However, there are some distinct differences:

### Manual FLAMEZ
- You need to manually harvest or compound (reinvest) your FLAMEZ, which involves revisiting the site, clicking buttons, and spending a small amount of BNB on transaction fees.
- Interest is displayed as APR, which does not include compounding.
- Deposits Token to your wallet upon staking.

### Auto FLAMEZ
- Stake your FLAMEZ and forget about it! The FLAMEZ you stake in this Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
- The "automatic" compounding function is initiated by other users, who receive a small bounty for triggering it.
- Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
- A small performance fee is deducted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below for more details.
- An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manual staking. See below for more information.
- Does not deposit to your wallet upon staking.

## What are the fees for the Auto FLAMEZ Pool?
### Deposit fee
- None.

### Unstaking fee
- 0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.
- Only applies within 3 days of manual staking.
- After 3 days, you can unstake without any fees.
- The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more FLAMEZ in the pool.
- This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

### Performance fee
- 2%, automatically deducted from each yield harvest.
- For example, if the harvest was 1 FLAMEZ, then 0.02 FLAMEZ would be deducted as the performance fee.

The FLAMEZ collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is burned every week as part of the regular FLAMEZ token burns. This process reduces the total amount of FLAMEZ tokens in existence, thereby helping curb inflation.

## What's the best way to use the Auto FLAMEZ Pool?
It's simple: stake your FLAMEZ, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if necessary). This way, you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

## What’s the Auto FLAMEZ bounty?
- Auto FLAMEZ Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto FLAMEZ pool users’ pending yield.

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users. Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto FLAMEZ Pool’s compounding function for everyone. Ensure that the amount of FLAMEZ you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
