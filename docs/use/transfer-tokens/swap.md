# Token Swaps

Token swaps on Flamez are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools on BBC Smart Chain, Ethereum and Aptos, and also with market makers when trading tokens on BBC Smart Chain and Ethereum.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the BBC Smart Chain or Ethereum Flamez Exchange, you will pay trading fees according to the type of liquidity pool your trade is being routed through. You may check the route details by clicking the magnifier icon on the “Route” section.

For Exchange  liquidity pools, there are currently four different fee tiers: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%.

For StableSwap liquidity pools, the fee rate depends on the individual pool configurations. Please check the “Fee” section for more detail.


Please note that on Aptos, only Flamez Exchange V2 is deployed, therefore all the token swaps on Aptos will have a fixed 0.25% trading fee with the same breakdown as mentioned above.
