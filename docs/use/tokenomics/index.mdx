### Token Supply Mechanics

The $FLAMEZ token supply mechanics are designed to create a sustainable and balanced ecosystem, combining inflationary and deflationary mechanisms to optimize long-term value and utility. These mechanisms include:

- **Inflationary Rewards:** A fixed annual inflation rate is implemented to incentivize active participation and contribution to the Flamez ecosystem. This rewards users who actively engage with the platform and hold $FLAMEZ tokens.

- **Deflationary Burning:** A portion of transaction fees or platform revenue is used to buy back and burn $FLAMEZ tokens. This mechanism reduces the circulating supply over time, potentially increasing the token's scarcity and value.

### Staking and Rewards

Token holders can stake their $FLAMEZ tokens to earn various rewards and benefits:

- **Staking Rewards:** Users who stake their $FLAMEZ tokens will receive additional tokens as rewards, encouraging long-term holding and participation in the Flamez ecosystem.

- **Governance Participation:** $FLAMEZ token holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals, shaping the platform's development, and influencing important decisions within the Flamez community.

- **Community Engagement:** A portion of the token supply is allocated for community rewards, including airdrops, staking incentives, and promotional campaigns. These initiatives aim to foster an active and vibrant community.

### Governance

$FLAMEZ token holders are granted governance rights, allowing them to participate in the decision-making process of the Flamez platform. Governance features include:

- **Voting Rights:** Token holders can vote on proposals related to platform upgrades, parameter adjustments, and protocol changes.

- **Delegation:** Users can delegate their voting power to trusted individuals or entities, ensuring a more inclusive and decentralized governance process.

- **Proposal Threshold and Quorum Requirements:** Specific requirements are in place to ensure that proposals meet a minimum threshold of support and that decisions have significant community participation.

By implementing these tokenomics, Flamez aims to create a robust ecosystem where token holders are incentivized to actively contribute, stakeholders have a say in the platform's evolution, and the token's value is protected and enhanced over time.
